Matplotlib includes a sub-library called pyplot, which creates an interface similar to that of the commercial software Matlab, and contains functions very similar to it.\n",
        "\n",
        "There are libraries like Seaborn that can automatically beautify the figures or give them a different style, but we will not be integrating them in this training.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, Matplotlib is a very rich library, and not all its functionalities can be covered. This training chooses to explore certain functions more than others, with the overall goal of enabling any student to become proficient with the module by the end of the course.\n",
        "\n",
        "To begin, it's necessary to import the matplotlib.pyplot module under the shortened name of 'plt'. <br>\n",
        "Once a graph is constructed, the plt.show() command will allow you to visualize it.<br>\n",
        "However, in a Notebook, like here on collab, adding %matplotlib inline at the beginning of the page will automatically display the figures with each modification or use of a pyplot command, after the execution of the cell.<br>\n",
