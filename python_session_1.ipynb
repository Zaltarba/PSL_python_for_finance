        "### Basic Usage\n",

        "To print a simple message or variable's value, you can use the `print` function like this:\n",

        "age = 30\n",
        "print(f\"Bob is {age} years old.\")\n",
        "```\n",
        "2.   Using the str.format() method:\n",
        "```\n",
        "print(\"Bob is {} years old.\".format(age))\n",
        "```\n",
        "3. Using %-formatting:\n",
